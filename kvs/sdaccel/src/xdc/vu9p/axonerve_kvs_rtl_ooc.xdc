# Define clock constraints for out of context synthesis/implementation runs only. This clock will
# be overwritten when the kernel is linked into the SDx system. Out of context results will provide
# an optimistic view of timing closure compared to final place and route results in a loaded
# system. Modifications to the clock here will have no bearing on xclbin timing.

# Secondary clock is async to ap_clk. Same notes above apply here.
